I have created `cerver/utils/generatedRefreshToken.js`. This should resolve the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `generatedRefreshToken.js`.

Now, with all the missing files recreated, the application should ideally start without `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors.

I will wait for the user to provide the next output from `nodemon`.
